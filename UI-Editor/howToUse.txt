<h3>Hello World</h3>

The UI-Editor allows you to dynamically set any installed Look and Feel (LAF) for your NetBeans platform. Unlike other methods and plugins used to set a LAF, the UI-Editor also allows you to dynamically modify and apply UI specific properties such as fonts, colors, dimensions, and insets for virtually every component type. At the very least, each property's value is cleary displayed to the user (such as the actual icon for most icon properties).

<h3>Time to LAF</h3>

You should begin by choosing which look and feel you would like to apply from the 'Look And Feel' drop down menu. To apply the LAF, simply click the 'Set Look And Feel' button located to the right of the drop down menu. You can see which LAF is currently applied and its description to the right of that button. Not all LAFs are created equal, check out the 'Known Issues' tab in this popup to see which LAFs are the easiest to modify.

<h3>Customize</h3>

Once your desired LAF is set, you can modify individual properties in the tree table. Property names are listed alphabetically in the 'Properties' column. When you expand a parent node, all individual editable and non-editable properties are displayed as leaf nodes. The actual value of the property is displayed in the 'Value' column. If a property is editable, clicking on it will allow you to change the value. In most cases, a button will also appear to the right of the property value. Clicking this button will display a UI popup that gives you a much more convenient way of changing the property.

To apply your properties, click the 'Apply Properties' button located at the bottom right corner of the table. Most properties should update immediately, but some properties (such as Fonts), sometimes require a restart of NetBeans. See the 'Known  Issues' tab for more information.

<h3>Save and Sound</h3>

Once you find a setup you like, you can click the 'Save as My Default' button located in the top-right corner of the UI-Editor. This will save your defaults and automatically reload them every time you start NetBeans. The 'Erase My Defaults' button should be self explanatory, but in case it isn't, clicking it will erase your custom settings and reload the default LAF next time NetBeans starts. The 'Reset All' button will attempt to reset the default LAF and UI properties for your platform.
