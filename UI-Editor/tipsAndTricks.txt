<h3>Which LAF should I use?</h3>

Of all the installed LAFs, <b>Metal</b> appears to be the most easily customizable with Color, Inset, and Dimension values appearing to always apply immediately.
<br><br>
Font values usually take effect on the first application, but subsequent applications don't <i>appear</i> to take effect. After applying one Font change, I've noticed that if you apply a second Font change, you usually have to save your settings and restart NetBeans for the effect to take place.
<br><br>
<b>Nimbus</b> appears to be the least customizable LAF, though sometimes you have to use the 'save and restart' method above for changes to take effect.

<h3> Tree Table Tips</h3>

<b>Sorting</b><br>
Clicking on a column header once will sort the column values in ascending order. Clicking on it a second time will sort the values in descending order and clicking on it a third time will put the rows in their original order.
<br><br>
<b>Search</b><br>
To execute a text-based search, click on any non-editable cell and being typing. A search area will appear in the bottom-left corder of the table. You can edit the parameters of your search from here.
<br><br>
<b>Show/Hide Columns</b><br>
Either right-click on a column header or click the button that appears in the top-right corner of the table to show and hide columns.
