Netbeans-UI-Editor-Plugin
=========================
NetBeans Plugin Module (.nbm) that allows you to change the Look and Feel of NetBeans on the fly and modify custom 
properties. Changes can be saved and automatically applied whenever NetBeans starts up. The .nbm file is located in the
build directory. Description from the NetBeans website is below:

NetBeans dynamic UI editor. Set your Look And Feel (LAF), modify some (editable) UI properties, and customize your 
NetBeans look! See what the Nimbus LAF looks like compared to the CDE/Motif LAF! Customize everything from font sizes, 
font colors, and background colors for virtually every component type (menus, buttons, etc)!
